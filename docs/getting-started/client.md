# Creating a sitekey

Log in to the [Dashboard](https://app.friendlycaptcha.com/dashboard) and head to the [Applications page](https://https://app.friendlycaptcha.com/dashboard/accounts/-/apps).

Click **Create New Application** and enter the necessary details.

Once you have completed this, take note of the sitekey value under the application name, we will need it in the next step.

A sitekey always starts with the characters `FC`.
