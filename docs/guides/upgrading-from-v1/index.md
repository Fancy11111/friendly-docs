## Changes to your website (front-end changes)

### Script tag installation

If you installed Friendly Captcha to your website by adding a `<script>` tag, follow [this guide](./script.md).

### Programmatic JavaScript API

If you are using the Javascript API to programmatically create widgets, please follow [this guide](./javascript-api.md).

If you are using a [plugin or library](/integrations) that adds Friendly Captcha to your framework or CMS, usually you only have to update your plugin.

We are working on bringing v2 support to all popular languages and frameworks.
