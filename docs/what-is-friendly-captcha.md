## What is different about Friendly Captcha?

Other captcha systems like [Google reCAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA) or [hCaptcha](https://hcaptcha.com) rely on user tasks like clicking images of cars for their protection.

These tasks are annoying for all users, but they are also a barrier for many users. It is not just (deaf)blind users that struggle, but also less technically savvy people like the elderly.

Another reason many organizations adopt Friendly Captcha is for data protection and privacy reasons. Friendly Captcha does not rely on user tracking or cookies for its protection, and offers a true EU-only offering.

## How does Friendly Captcha work?
The Friendly Captcha widget serves a cryptographic puzzle which is solved by the user's device. The Friendly Captcha system analyzes various signals to compute a risk score, based on this risk score the difficulty of the puzzle challenge is increased.

This happens in the background, by the time the user is ready to submit a form on your website, the challenge is often already completed.
